# Getting started

1. Install `node` and `npm`
2. `npm install --dev` from this directory
3. To run a local dev build: `yarn start`
4. To build a release (for github-pages hosting): `yarn build-gh`. It will put a new release in the `docs` directory. **Pushing that to main will make it live** at http://valrus.github.io/collaborative-blackout-poetry.
